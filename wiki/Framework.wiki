== Introduction ==

This is the application framework for !ActionScript 3<br>
which have the only purpose to provide portable<br>
cross-platform and standard packages.

The *maashaack application framework*<br>
(codename *x4a* eg. "anything for ActionScript")<br>
is a set of different modular projects assembled together<br>
to produce a coherent set of AS3 classes, packages and libraries<br>
which represent our ideal of "programming in the large".

Don't get confused by the word "framework", <br>
we don't impose any architecture, abstract design,<br>
default behaviour or force you to use subclassing<br>
here you can read "application framework" as<br>
"the minimal set of libraries to write an application".

== Portability ==

 * Flash Player 9
 * Flash Player 10
 * Flash Player 10.1
 * AIR 1.0
 * AIR 1.5
 * [http://www.adobe.com/products/air/ AIR 2.0] ~~Apollo~~
 * [http://code.google.com/p/redtamarin/ redtamarin]

== Details ==

Inspired by such projects as Mono, Python, Ruby, etc.
the goal here is to provide a set of libraries that
are made right from the start portable in the AS3 world.

The focus is on the AS3 language, APIs available in
Flash 9, AIR ~~Apollo~~, !ActionScript 3 or any other AS3 host.
