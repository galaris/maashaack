     * Calculates a number between two numbers at a specific increment. 
     * The lerp function is convenient for creating motion along a straight path and for drawing dotted lines.
     * <p>Lerp is an abbreviation for linear interpolation, which can also be used as a verb (Raymond 2003).</p> 
     * <p>Linear interpolation is a method of curve fitting using linear polynomials. 
     * It is heavily employed in mathematics (particularly numerical analysis), and numerous applications including computer graphics. It is a simple form of interpolation.</p>
     * <p><b>Example :</b></p>
     * <pre class="prettyprint">
     * import core.maths.lerp ;
     * trace( lerp( 0 , 100 , 0.5 ) ; // 50
     * </pre>
     * @param amount The amount to interpolate between the two values where 0.0 equal to the first point, 0.1 is very near the first point, 0.5 is half-way in between, etc. 
     * @param start the begining value.
     * @param end The ending value.
     * @return The interpolated value between two numbers at a specific increment.
