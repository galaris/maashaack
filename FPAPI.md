## Introduction ##

**FPAPI** stands for the **Flash Platform API**.

It allows us to refer to the **Flash Player API** (FP API)
and/or the **Adobe Integrated Runtime API** (AIR API)
in our/your usage of the AS3 language.

We will mention the **FPAPI** mainly to inform with
which version of Flash and/or AIR a particular
package or library or tool etc. can works.


## Details ##

Here how the **FPAPI** versioning works:

  * anything starting with _FP works with the **Flash Player**_<br />and will also work with AIR
  * anything starting with _AIR works with the **Adobe Integrated Runtime**_<br />but will not necessary work with the Flash player
  * if no **FPAPI** is mentioned we default to **FP\_9\_0**
  * a change of API version can introduce languages features, SWF features, etc.
  * refer to the table bellow to see which is compatible with what

Our advice is when you start to implement something
simply base it on the current stable **FPAPI**.

If you need backward compatibility with earlier version,
then use [conditional compilation](ConditionalCompilation.md)
and works your way back in the code.

**note:**
  * after Flash Player 10.2, SWF version got incremented for each dot release
  * since AIR SDK 3.6 you have 2 versions of the SDK, one with ASC2, one with ASC that can be merged with the Flex SDK
  * SWF version is the minimum SWF version supported in the Flex SDK
  * AIR SDK is the version provided by default in the Flex SDK
  * bold is the last stable version
  * something followed by ? means "not sure"
  * ??? means no idea
  * correction/contribution/comments welcome :)
  * "Our current plan is to change the next version of AIR (code named King and scheduled for Q2) to version 13, bringing it in line with Flash Playerâ€™s version number." see [adobe forums](http://forums.adobe.com/message/6001351#6001351)

### Examples ###

If your class depends on **FPAPI** **FP\_10\_2** (Flash Player 10.2)
  * it will also works with **AIR\_2\_6** (AIR 2.6)
  * and any successive version of Flash Player (10.3, 11, 11.1, etc.)
  * and any successive version of AIR (2.7, 3.0, 3.1, etc.)

if your class depends on **FPAPI** **AIR\_3\_3** (AIR 3.3)
  * it will not work with **FP\_11\_3** (Flash Player 11.3)
  * it will work with any successive version of AIR (3.4, 3.5, etc.)
