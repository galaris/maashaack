The **maashaack application framework**<br>
is a set of different modular projects assembled together<br>
to produce a coherent set of AS3 classes, packages and libraries<br>
which represent our ideal of "programming in the large".<br>
<br>
<a href='Framework.md'>Maashaack Application Framework</a>

<br><br>

The <b>maashaack projects</b><br>
are independent modules which focus on one particular set of problem,<br>
they fit the need of "programming in the small".<br>
<br>
One of the goal is to write first applications<br>
and then reinject the general code into an organized structure.<br>
<br>
It could become part of the packages, libraries, platform libraries<br>
or tools, see the <a href='OverView.md'>documentation overview</a>.<br>
<br>
Off course if you feel you're into that <a href='Philosophy.md'>Philosophy</a>, you're welcome to participate<br>
with your own project, see <a href='Organization#Add_your_Project_to_maashaack.md'>add your Project to maashaack</a>.<br>
