 * <code class="prettyprint">
 * var o:Object = { a : 5 , b : 6 } ;
 * trace( core.dump( core.objects.getMembers( o ) ) ) ; // [a,b]
 * trace( core.dump( core.objects.getMembers( o , true ) ) ) ; // [5,6]
 * </code>
 * @return Array containing all the string key names or values (if the byValue argument is true). The method returns null if no members are finding.
