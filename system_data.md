An **abstract data type** (**ADT**) is a model for a certain class of data structures that have similar behavior; or for certain data types of one or more programming languages that have similar semantics.

The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, allowing them to be manipulated independently of the details of their representation. It reduces programming effort while increasing performance.

The **system.data collection** framework is loosely inspired on the [JAVA Collections Framework](http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/guide/collections/) and the [Jakarta Collections Framework](http://commons.apache.org/collections/).

This framework is inspired on interfaces to defines the different types of collections :
  * [Map](system_data_maps.md)
  * Bag
  * Collections
  * Iterator
  * Set
  * Queue & Stack
